# standing_predictor

Dependencies:
-sqlite3
-libcurl
-libgumbo (if you want to run the meta-analysis)

Build instructions:
1) Download this project and https://github.com/1425/tba so that the two directories are in the same parent directory.
2) Build the "tba" library to talk to The Blue Alliance
3) Get an access key to talk to The Blue Alliance; this is available on their website and is pretty painless.
4) Check that your access key is working with the “demo” program.
5) Go to the standing_predictor directory and run “make”
6) Run the resulting executable “outline”
