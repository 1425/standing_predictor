constraints:
-awards given out via the rules
  -0 or 1 of most things at district events
  -special numbers given out at DCMP
  -5 pts for judged team awards
  -most awards must go to different teams, but not safety
  -rookies (& have they already won Rookie All-Star)
  -who is qualified to win chairmans award?
-ranking points given out to teams at different events
  -no teams rank the same at a given event
-alliance selection points
  -no teams chosen at the same point
-playoff perf points
  -backup robots
  -max numbers of matches won at each level of playoffs at each event
    -rules to know how many matches there were played

Questions to ask:
What are the min & max values that the cutoff might be?
Is it possible for team X to make it the DCMP? to worlds?
What is the worst that team X can do in upcoming events to still be able to make it?
What is the worst that team X can do to gauruntee that they do make it?
(answer w/ or without assuming that might win chairmans/other auto qual)

First step:
Assume that have only like 3 teams and want to know top 1
Assume that only one event ever

Output format:
1) Green=qualified
2) Red=cannot qualify
3) Orange=cannot qualify on points
4) White=Can qualify on points
